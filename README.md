# ip-reputation-scanner
Relieving the manual task of checking the ip reputation

For now, API calls are made to VirusTotal, AlienVaultOTX, FraudGuard and AbuseIPDB. In all those places you can get API key for free (but with daily / monthly limits)

Run script, select IP list from csv or insert single IP. Results are displayed and saved to the file.

### Exemplary result for single IP
